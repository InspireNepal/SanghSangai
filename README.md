# SanghSangai - Team Introduction

Sangh-Sangai, meaning “together” in Nepali, is a TearFund project in Nepal under a Scottish Government program working in disaster risk reduction, against gender based violence, health, community transformation & livelihood. Continuing from an INSPIRE Nepal 2022 project, this year’s team is hoping to build on the remarkable MVP development carried out by 2022 Fall cohort of INSPIRE’s Nepal wing for Business Intelligence insights and impact measurement visualization for TearFund and it’s partner NGOs across Nepal.
