    "content": "In this sprint, some of the tasks that our team carried out were setting up Azure DevOps, follow up meeting with community partner and resolved frontend issues. Our team mostly focused on frontend issues these two weeks and we gave a demo of the issues that we fixed to our community partner. It was a good experience learning more about DevOps and it was really beneficial to our team.\n\nWhile giving demo of the updated features in the system to our community partner, we had some experiences. It was our first time showing the updates. We interacted with Micah Nepal’s representative about the features and issues that has already been implemented and to be implemented. We gained some feedbacks and we will try to work on those in the upcoming days.\n\nWhile dealing with sprint tasks, we felt that our progress was super slow. We spent most of our times on fixing small issues on the existing system. We felt that we still have a lot to learn and improve on. We need to focus more on learning the required technologies in depth. We know few things but that’s not enough for implementing the requirements we gathered from our Community partner. We need to be focusing more on understanding the system in the best way possible. We think that we will need to cover up our speed in the upcoming sprint.",

    "content": "During this sprint, our team accomplished several key tasks. First, we conducted an in-depth system study to gain a better understanding of the project. Next, we generated dummy data using Postman, creating Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), and also collected data from a web form to test its functionality. We allocated a significant amount of time to enhance our comprehension of the system's intricacies.\n\nWe had a productive meeting with our main Community Partner(Micah Nepal) to discuss project details.We also  followed up with Tearfund to maintain communication and progress tracking of the system.\n\n  We also dedicated effort to prepare a presentation for playback-II, as we wanted to improve upon our previous performance in this regard. Additionally, we conducted trial runs to ensure everything was functioning smoothly.\n\n What's equally noteworthy is the remarkable progress we've witnessed within our team dynamics. There's a genuine sense of openness and camaraderie that has emerged among team members, which has greatly contributed to an atmosphere of trust and seamless collaboration.It's worth mentioning that, at one point this week, we encountered a minor conflict within the team concerning the choice of colors in our presentation.\n\nHowever, I'm pleased to say that we successfully resolved this issue through constructive dialogue and compromise. This experience highlights our team's ability to address challenges head-on and work together to find creative solutions, strengthening our overall cohesiveness and problem-solving capabilities.",

    "content": "During this month, we all had been working and learning together. After the team division, we worked together while making content which includes our introduction, team photo and information about our community partners  for our  project web page\n\nOur team got to meet one of the community partner Tearfund Nepal’s representatives on 14th September, Friday. In this meeting, we had a general introduction sharing session. We agreed to have a meeting once a week with Micah Nepal and once every two weeks with Tearfund Nepal\n\nOn 14th September, Friday we had our first playback. The main focus was to introduce our project to the Canada team. We worked effectively while making the presentation. We understood each of our strengths and weaknesses. Each member contributed while getting the presentation ready. There were some confusions regarding what we should include and what we should not\n\nWe believe that the playback did not go as we planned. We made some mistakes which we will make sure to correct in the next playback. Also, we will be working on our communication and presentation skills to feel more confident in the upcoming meetings. One thing that we realized is that we need more preparation beforehand. Due to limited time, we were also not able to conduct a dry run. We believe these mistakes should be taken positively and work on it so that it will not be repeated next time.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience and we are enjoying the process. We’re looking forward to collaborating within our team and bringing out the best in each other.",
